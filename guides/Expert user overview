Here is a rundown to skip the notebooks.


To devlop locally and then run at scale:

* Download the empty directory structure from google drive
* grab all the confluence repos leading up to the module you care about, skip priors and before you run prediagnostics, make a copy of the swot data at /empty_mnt/input/swot
* for each module (setfinder as an example):
    * make changes if you want
    * cd setfinder
    * docker build -t travissimmons/setfinder:latest .
    * look at the setfinder module page on this website that has the docker run command, and run it to test on some reaches
    * make a repo on your dockerhub for it, mine is called setfinder
    * docker docker push travissimmons/setfinder:latest
    * go on your hpc that has singularity or apptainer
    * singularity build setfinder.simg docker://travissimmons/setfinder
    * write a job submissoin script to run it (the run commands are on the module page on this website)
